# Project04 2D Platformer - Monochrome Madness

This was our fourth project for MSCH-C220, a 2D Platformer with multiple levels and enemies. Completed on 3/18/2022.

## Added Features
Player can double jump.

Added soundtrack.

Added sound effects for bat enemies, walking, and picking up coins.

Multiple levels.

Better save/load system (now saves the level the player is on, and displays level on the load button)

New black-and-white sprites from kenney.nl, as well as edited original sprites from older exercises.

## References
Level 1 was loosely inspired by level 1-1 from Super Mario Bros.

## Future Development
I would like to add more menus and longer levels, with more sound effects and background sprites.
